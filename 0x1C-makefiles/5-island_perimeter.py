"""
    Contains the definition of the island_perimeter function that returns the
    perimeter of the island described in 'grid'.

    grid is a list of list of integers:
        0 represents a water zone
        1 represents a land zone
        One cell is a square with side length 1
        Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
        Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
    Grid is completely surrounded by water and there is 1 island (or nothing).
    The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the
    water around the island).
